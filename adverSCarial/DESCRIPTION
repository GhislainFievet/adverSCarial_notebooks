Description:
    adverSCarial is an R Package designed for generating and analyzing the vulnerability of scRNA-seq
    classifiers to adversarial attacks. The package is versatile and provides a format for integrating
    any type of classifier. It offers functions for studying and generating two types of attacks,
    min change attack and max change attack. The min change attack involves making a small modification
    to the input to alter the classification. The max change attack involves making a large modification
    to the input without changing its classification.
    The package provides a comprehensive solution for evaluating the robustness of scRNA-seq classifiers
    against adversarial attacks.
